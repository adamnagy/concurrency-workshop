1. SwimminRace01
	There is a pool with N lane. There are swimmers coming to swim. If there are exactly N, they are started to swim.
	Swimmers want to got to the sauna than go to the swimming pool again and again.
	You should not take into account, that only N swimmers should be in the pool at the same time.
	Organize only the start of the race.
2. SwimminRace02
	Take into account, that only ONE swimmer should be in one lane. So other swimmers should wait not only to each other to
	gather but for the previous race to finish.
